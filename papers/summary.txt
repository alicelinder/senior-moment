** Community Assembly, Niche Conservatism, and Adaptive Evolution in Changing Environments

————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

- Exploring connection between community assemble (and other ecological sorting
processes as causes for functional trait distributions at local/landscape level)
- Based on theory that plants in saturated communities occupy areas that are optimal
or near-optimal environments for them -> functional traits reflect this stabilizing
selection
- Climate change and trailing edge populations causing a mismatch between environmental
conditions and the environmental niche a species occupies
- Distribution of plant species = influence of abiotic and biotic interactions (community assembly
 process)
- plasticity within species changes functional traits
- local variation in functional traits reflects niche partitioning in heterogenous environments 
within the community
- concept of phylogenetic conservation of traits (how similar are functional traits on a
phylogeny?
- Hutchinsonian niche space: physiological tolerances (fundamental niche) and performance in the
 presence of competitors and other biotic interactions (realized niche)
- A population may exhibit one or more of several responses to changing environments: 
	1) local shifts in microhabitat or altitudinal distribution 
	2) large-scale changes in geographic distribution, entailing both range expansions 
and range extirpation in the former range
	3) adaptive evolution of the niche in response to the new conditions
	4) extinction
- populations are not likely to adapt genetically fast enough to resist eventual invasion of
 competitors from adjacent positions
- history of rapid migration supports the view that species replacement usually outpaces local adaptation
- leading edge will be either:
	1. the site of extinction
	2. site of range shift (populations track favored conditions)
- if there is a lack of competitors, then there is greater dispersal capability in a species
- if climate change is rapid, then adaptive responses may be more prevalent (trailing edge hypothesis)
- moving a species north would move the species to areas of lower rainfall; this shift is tolerated
due to the greater niche breadth along the precipitation axis
- potential for adaptive evolution is observed for the same factor for which the species has a broader fundamental niche
- See Fig. 7 for diagram indicating responses of species with asymmetric niche breadths to changing environments
- Look for model including multiple species, overlapping niche distributions, and simultaneous
 responses to climate change in all species
- only a limited set of environmental conditions exists, so species can’t track preferred
 environment simultaneously in multiple dimensions
	- effective dispersal will cause species to track preferred conditions for factors with
 narrow tolerances, counteracting potential for stronger selection (“relative niche breadth”
hypothesis)

** Demographic compensation and tipping points in climate-induced range shifts

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

- understand why species respond differently, some in range shifts and some in range
contractions
- evidence for (latitudinal and elevational) range shifts in recent decades from 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
- looked at 2 species of tundra plants: moss campion and distort
- also included size of plants in models
- both species exhibited die-out in the southern limits of their latitudinal extreme
- provides evidence for stronger plants in their range limits, with factors such as
survival, fruits/area, and growth
- measured vital rates across 4 sites on a latitudinal gradient
- survival and growth rates, as well as reproductive factors

** CLIMATE ISN’T EVERYTHING: COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AND VARIATION BY LIFE STAGE
***  WILL ALSO AFFECT RANGE SHIFTS IN A WARMING WORLD

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

- great paper for citations/good starting off point for recent literature
- overall study examines competitive and climatic factors on growth of saplings and
adults of three conifer species in Mt. Rainier Park
- discussion about “climate envelope” moving up and possible 4 effects on tree species
ranges, climate vs. competition controlling limits?
- quantified annual growth at 7 sites using ring widths across elevational gradient
- hypothesized that climate limits upper range limits at high elevations and competitive
 interactions limit growth at lower range limits
- include descriptions of sites in Methods (study sites and species)
- look up PET (potential evapotranspiration)
- consider putting in climate variables to isolate further effects of range extremes
- fit linear mixed effects models using maximum likelihood estimates
- climate variables related to snowpack were best predictors of growth
- increased sensitivity to climate at treeline
- did “strength of climatic influence on growth” WHAT IS THIS STAT FROM?
- competition influenced sapling growth more than adult tree growth
- suggests examining whether tree is in the overstory
- competition and climate likely both play a part in determining range extremes — worth
writing about in my paper if the data is available?
- bioclimatic models should include both biotic interactions and information from
multiple life history stages

** Asymmetric changes of growth and reproductive investment herald altitudinal 
*** and latitudinal range shifts of two woody species

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

- Study on demographical structure (density, age and mortality rate), growth, 
reproduction investment and damage from herbivory of Pinus sylvestris and Juniperus 
communis. 
- Observations taken across latitudinal and altitudinal gradient (altitude data 
collected at southern edge). 
- Introduction holds very good information on types of range shifts, necessary 
characteristics of life strategies for trees that face population loss/gain at their 
southern and northern edges respectively. 
- Interesting graph/diagram of range limits and locations of data collection (use 
something like this in ArcGIS?) 
- Study used generalized linear mixed models. 
- Look up Akaike information criterion and Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion. 
- Proportion of saplings for P. sylvestris <10cm to larger individuals was much higher 
at the northern range limit (no such pattern for J. communis). 
- Authors caution generalizing across latitudinal range, suggesting consideration of 
atmospheric pressure, temperature, or variations in seasonal changes and photoperiods. 
- Also consider biotic factors (land use and ecological disturbances)
