Matias and Jump: Asymmetric changes of growth and reproductive investment herald altitudinal and latitudinal range shifts of two woody species

Study on demographical structure (density, age and mortality rate), growth, reproduction investment and damage from herbivory of Pinus sylvestris and Juniperus communis. Observations taken across latitudinal and altitudinal gradient (altitude data collected at southern edge). Introduction holds very good information on types of range shifts, necessary characteristics of life strategies for trees that face population loss/gain at their southern and northern edges respectively. Interesting graph/diagram of range limits and locations of data collection (use something like this in ArcGIS?) Study used generalized linear mixed models. Look up Akaike information criterion and Schwarzâ€™s Bayesian information criterion. Proportion of saplings for P. sylvestris <10cm to larger individuals was much higher at the northern range limit (no such pattern for J. communis). Authors caution generalizing across latitudinal range, suggesting consideration of atmospheric pressure, temperature, or variations in seasonal changes and photoperiods. Also consider biotic factors (land use and ecological disturbances)
