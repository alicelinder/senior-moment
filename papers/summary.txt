** Demographic compensation and tipping points in climate-induced range shifts

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

- understand why species respond differently, some in range shifts and some in range
contractions
- evidence for (latitudinal and elevational) range shifts in recent decades from 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
- looked at 2 species of tundra plants: moss campion and distort
- also included size of plants in models
- both species exhibited die-out in the southern limits of their latitudinal extreme
- provides evidence for stronger plants in their range limits, with factors such as
survival, fruits/area, and growth
- measured vital rates across 4 sites on a latitudinal gradient
- survival and growth rates, as well as reproductive factors

** CLIMATE ISN’T EVERYTHING: COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AND VARIATION BY LIFE STAGE
***  WILL ALSO AFFECT RANGE SHIFTS IN A WARMING WORLD

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

- great paper for citations/good starting off point for recent literature
- overall study examines competitive and climatic factors on growth of saplings and
adults of three conifer species in Mt. Rainier Park
- discussion about “climate envelope” moving up and possible 4 effects on tree species
ranges, climate vs. competition controlling limits?
- quantified annual growth at 7 sites using ring widths across elevational gradient
- hypothesized that climate limits upper range limits at high elevations and competitive
 interactions limit growth at lower range limits
- include descriptions of sites in Methods (study sites and species)
- look up PET (potential evapotranspiration)
- consider putting in climate variables to isolate further effects of range extremes
- fit linear mixed effects models using maximum likelihood estimates
- climate variables related to snowpack were best predictors of growth
- increased sensitivity to climate at treeline
- did “strength of climatic influence on growth” WHAT IS THIS STAT FROM?
- competition influenced sapling growth more than adult tree growth
- suggests examining whether tree is in the overstory
- competition and climate likely both play a part in determining range extremes — worth
writing about in my paper if the data is available?
- bioclimatic models should include both biotic interactions and information from
multiple life history stages

** Asymmetric changes of growth and reproductive investment herald altitudinal 
*** and latitudinal range shifts of two woody species

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

- Study on demographical structure (density, age and mortality rate), growth, 
reproduction investment and damage from herbivory of Pinus sylvestris and Juniperus 
communis. 
- Observations taken across latitudinal and altitudinal gradient (altitude data 
collected at southern edge). 
- Introduction holds very good information on types of range shifts, necessary 
characteristics of life strategies for trees that face population loss/gain at their 
southern and northern edges respectively. 
- Interesting graph/diagram of range limits and locations of data collection (use 
something like this in ArcGIS?) 
- Study used generalized linear mixed models. 
- Look up Akaike information criterion and Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion. 
- Proportion of saplings for P. sylvestris <10cm to larger individuals was much higher 
at the northern range limit (no such pattern for J. communis). 
- Authors caution generalizing across latitudinal range, suggesting consideration of 
atmospheric pressure, temperature, or variations in seasonal changes and photoperiods. 
- Also consider biotic factors (land use and ecological disturbances)
